ðŸ“š Library Management System (Java Console Application)
ðŸ”¹ Overview

The Library Management System is a console-based Java application that simulates a basic library system.
Users can add books, view all books, search, issue, and return books, all through a simple text-based menu.

This project is built to practice core Java concepts, object-oriented programming (OOP), and collections.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Add Books â€“ Add new books with ID, Name, and Author.

View Books â€“ Display all books with their details and current status (Available/Issued).

Search Books â€“ Find a book by its ID and view its details.

Issue Books â€“ Mark a book as issued if it is available.

Return Books â€“ Mark a book as returned.

Menu-Driven Interface â€“ Easy navigation through a console menu.

ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used

Java 8+

ArrayList for dynamic storage of books

Scanner for user input

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts: Classes, Objects, Methods, Encapsulation

ðŸ”¹ How It Works

The program displays a menu with options:
Add Books, View Books, Search Books, Issue Books, Return Books, Exit.

The user selects an option and performs the corresponding action.

The book data is stored in an ArrayList in memory.

Each book has a status flag (Issued or Available) to track its availability.
